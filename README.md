## INTRODUCTION

Police brutality is the repression by personnel affiliated with law enforcement
when dealing with suspects and civilians. Police violence has become a hot-button
problem in the United States in recent years, particularly with Michael Brown's
fatal shooting at Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. The Black Lives Matter Movement
founded in 2014 was a vocal aspect of the U.S. Police Brutality Movement through
the organization of "die-ins," rallies, and protests against the killing by police of
non-white men and women. The data from 2000 to 2016 of the civilian victims
killed by police and their racial, gender, age and residence identities have been
listed in the following dataset for our Data Analysis using R project.
